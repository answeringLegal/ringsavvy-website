Our service also never experiences outages. Ring Savvy has multiple backup generators and failsafes in place to keep us up and running during storms."},{question:"Why would I use a live answering service when I have voicemail?",answer:"Ring Savvy provides businesses with 24/7/365 live phone answering coverage, and ensures that their customers never have to deal with the frustration of being sent to voicemail during their time of need. We help companies in all industries turn more of their new leads into paying customers, by providing their callers a live, caring and knowledgeable voice."},{question:"Why would I use a live answering service when I have staff?",answer:"Ring Savvy provides support on the 3rd and 4th ring when your office fails to answer a call. This is great insurance for any business, as your in-office staff may not always be able to pick up a call during the day, and will very rarely be available to answer calls during after hours, weekends, and holidays. Ring Savvy can help you on a rollover basis by answering only the calls that you miss, giving you the ability to capture new business at a fraction of the cost!"}],c=[{question:"How does Ring Savvy work?",answer:"Ring Savvy uses conditional call forwarding in order to answer calls that you and your staff can’t get to.

To learn about the many call forwarding options you have with our service, we recommend checking out this page."},{question:"How are my calls answered?",answer:"The way that our virtual receptionists answer your phone calls is entirely up to you, although our most preferred greetings usually sound like, “Good morning, you’ve reach (insert name of business), how may I help you?” This is a brief, polite way to exert professionalism and let the caller know that the person answering the phone is a part of your business."},{question:"If I am on a call and another call is coming in, will it go to Ring Savvy?",answer:"Yes. Conditional call forwarding from Ring Savvy gives you the option to utilize call waiting or let the call ring and forward it over to our service to be answered by one of our trained virtual receptionists."},{question:"Can I still answer my own phone calls even though I have Ring Savvy?",answer:"Yes.

It all depends on your call volume."},{question:"How is my monthly price determined?",answer:"You’ll only be charged for the amount of minutes our virtual receptionist staff spends talking with your callers on the phone. We never round minutes up, and our receptionists have been trained to handle your calls with a high level of efficiency. We also won’t charge you for calls from telemarketers or for calls unrelated to your business. Our goal is to make sure you always get the most bang for your buck!"},{question:"Does Ring Savvy charge by the minute or by the call?",answer:"Ring Savvy charges per minute, and you only pay for what you use!"},{question:"Is there a monthly minimum?",answer:"Yes.

This sometimes happens when your phone provider experiences outages, or upgrades their system. This also happens when you add/remove features from your account. In order to reactivate service, our customer success team will place a ticket with your carrier or log into your portal. This change may be instantaneous or may take up to 48 hours."},{question:"My cell phone calls are not being picked up at all!",answer:"If you’ve changed/upgraded your cell phone, your call forwarding may no longer be active.

Here are some of our quick tutorials on forwarding your cell phone to Ring Savvy."},{question:"My cell phone rings too many times before Ring Savvy picks up the call! What is wrong?",answer:"This may have been caused by an update your cell phone provider has implemented, but the default amount of rings on a cell phone before forwarding is 6. If attempts to decrease the amount of rings is unsuccessful, dialing 611 from the cell phone and speaking to a representative usually helps. If a representative claims they can not make this fix, ask for a supervisor."},{question:"My landline rings too many times before Ring Savvy picks up the call! What is wrong?",answer:"Normally, this is an issue with your phone provider. Just let us know that you are hearing too many rings before the calls are answered and we still start running diagnostics on your lines.

Depending on your phone provider, this can be an instant fix or can take up to 48 hours."},{question:"I’m receiving voicemails, are my calls not forwarding?",answer:"Normally, this is an issue with your phone provider.
