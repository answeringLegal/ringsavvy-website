As soon as you open, you need to quickly get\n          to work on repairing vehicles that were left overnight in your lot,\n          and helping a line full of people looking to drop cars off. With not a\n          moment to spare, the task of answering incoming calls will often make\n          you want to pull your hair out.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          For those tired of stressful mornings, there is a phone answering\n          service that can help. Ring Savvy’s virtual receptionist team has\n          aided countless overwhelmed businesses in better managing their phone\n          lines, and is ready to do the same for yours.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Overflow call handling will allow you to take a breath</h2>\n        <p>\n          We know that auto repair shops experience a lot of pressure to answer\n          calls live, and that sending callers to voicemail often results in\n          potential customers turning to your competitors for help. Ring Savvy\n          will make sure that your callers never reach your voice mailbox, as we\n          not only operate on a 24/7/365 basis, but have a call center that is\n          always fully staffed with trained virtual receptionists. As a Ring\n          Savvy customer, you’ll always have our team at your disposal, and if\n          there is a morning where you are too busy to answer a single call on\n          your own, you can trust our receptionists to answer all of the calls\n          on your behalf. Our receptionists will greet your callers, operate in\n          a polite and professional manner, and ensure that your customers never\n          feel neglected or grow frustrated with your business.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Just imagine having the ability to pick and choose when you want to\n          answer customer calls. Imagine being able to finish a conversation\n          with a customer in your shop, even with a ringing phone in the\n          background. With Ring Savvy it’s all possible!\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Even if you already have receptionist help at your garage, overflow\n          call handling from Ring Savvy will still prove to be an incredibly\n          valuable backup resource. When receptionists are forced to constantly\n          multitask—for example trying to perform intake on a calling customer\n          while running a payment for another customer—mistakes get made, and\n          your company suffers for it. Our virtual receptionists will only focus\n          on one customer at a time, and can always be trusted to do their job\n          right.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Our receptionists go above and beyond</h2>\n        <p>\n          When you turn over a call to one of Ring Savvy’s virtual\n          receptionists, you’re not just getting a trustworthy live voice. All\n          of our receptionists have been carefully trained in taking customer\n          messages, performing new customer intake, and appointment scheduling.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If a customer calls into your shop asking for an update on the car\n          they dropped off, our receptionist can take their message, and send\n          that message to you via text and/or email message. You’ll be able to\n          view the message right from your mobile device, and provide the\n          customer with an update at your next free moment.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          When a person calls looking to bring a car in for maintenance or\n          repair, we’ve also got you covered. Our virtual receptionist will be\n          able to help you win over new business, by answering FAQs about your\n          repair shop. When signing up as a Ring Savvy customer, you’ll tell us\n          noteworthy things that our virtual receptionists should know about\n          your business (for example the price of a standard oil change), and\n          we’ll make sure that information is always available to your callers.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Our receptionists will also perform new customer intakes on anyone\n          interested in bringing their car in, so you’ll be able to best prepare\n          for their arrival. We can send you text and/or email messages after\n          the intake is performed, that includes the customer’s personal\n          information, as well as info like the make and model of their vehicle,\n          and their reason for bringing the vehicle in.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Finally, you’ll have the option to let our receptionists book new\n          appointments directly into your work calendar.

Most other answering services have multiple locations and\n          claim to hail from one location, but many of their agents are not\n          inside their offices, and instead work from home! This means that\n          someone who works for your answering service can have never met anyone\n          within the company face to face, and simply puts on a headset on\n          his/her couch in his/her living room and answers your professional\n          business calls. Our New York answering service has a higher standard.\n          All of our virtual receptionists and staff are in-house, meaning we\n          can better control the quality of every call and can monitor calls\n          throughout the entirety of the day.\n        </p>\n        <h4>\n          Here are some reasons why our New York answering service is your best\n          choice:\n        </h4>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            In-house receptionists means our quality control inside the office\n            fosters a sense of professionalism and inspires our receptionists to\n            remain polite and objective. There are no agents working from the\n            comfort of a couch, where they might not feel as professional and\n            will therefore not exert the right impression to your callers.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Since New York is the city that never sleeps, our New York answering\n            service does not sleep either!

Problems with toilets, sinks and showers are just not\n          something people can wait on, and because of this, calls for plumbing\n          assistance can literally come at anytime. If a customer reaches out to\n          your company’s phone lines, and you fail to provide a live answer,\n          your chances of getting that person’s business will go right down the\n          drain.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Make sure your plumbing business is always ready to help customers in\n          need, by utilizing Ring Savvy’s 24/7 phone answering service.

Our call\n          center remains active and fully staffed at all times, and does not\n          miss a single incoming call from any of the companies we serve. Our\n          plumber’s answering service will prove to be extremely valuable to\n          your business, as providing a live answer on that first phone call\n          means everything to your customers.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Sending new callers to your voicemail will signal to them that your\n          company doesn’t care about their needs or simply doesn’t have time to\n          help, and will usually result in potential customers turning to your\n          competitors for more immediate assistance. Getting to speak with one\n          of our highly trained virtual receptionists will make a much better\n          impression on prospective customers, as they will be able to answer\n          any FAQs the customer might have, and let them know that help is on\n          the way.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Intelligent call dispatching will help your team get to work</h2>\n        <p>\n          When a new customer opportunity arises, our number one goal will be to\n          get a member of your staff in on the call. You can let us know who our\n          first point of contact should be when a new customer calls in, and\n          we’ll briefly put the customer on hold and attempt to reach that\n          individual. You can decide to have different people serve as the main\n          contact for different days of the week or different plumbing issues.\n          Our receptionist staff will always be able to figure out the right\n          point of contact, and will give that person the option to have the\n          customer’s call transferred over to their line. This is of course a\n          best case scenario, as the customer will be able to immediately get\n          their questions answered by a member of your staff and setup a time to\n          have their plumbing issue addressed.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If our virtual receptionist tries but fails to get in contact with\n          anyone from your company, your chances at capturing the new customer\n          will not dramatically decrease. We’ll take the caller through the new\n          customer intake process, collecting information about their plumbing\n          issue through customized questions of your choosing. All the\n          information we gather will be sent you and your staff’s mobile devices\n          via text and/or email message. Once you see that an urgent request has\n          come in, you can have someone immediately call the customer back.\n          During your call back, customers are likely to be more agreeable and\n          understanding, having already spoken with a live representative of\n          your company.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          It shouldn’t take long for you to see the powerful impact our\n          plumber’s answering service has on your business.

When their computers or servers experience issues,\n          it usually puts their work days to a complete halt. IT companies never\n          know when they’ll be called upon for support, but when a company does\n          reach out to them, they expect immediate assistance. With this being\n          the case, being able to provide a live answer for all incoming\n          customer phone calls is a must.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If your IT business doesn’t already have staff answering calls 24/7,\n          you’ll want to invest in a high quality phone answering service to do\n          it for you. Ring Savvy’s virtual receptionist team is always live, and\n          will help ensure that your IT company is able to be there for\n          customers when technology fails them.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Ring Savvy will help you provide 24/7 support</h2>\n        <p>\n          One of the biggest things any business looks for these days when\n          hiring an IT company is 24/7 technical support. If your IT business\n          can’t advertise that it provides 24/7 support, it is going to struggle\n          to keep up with competitors. Providing the ability to submit a support\n          ticket on your website is not enough. When technical disasters strike,\n          your customers first thought will always be to call into your service.\n          If they are directed to your voicemail during their time of need, you\n          can expect your business to start racking up negative online reviews.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          With Ring Savvy, you’ll be able to advertise that you provide 24/7\n          support with confidence. Our call center remains active during all\n          hours of the day and night, even during weekends and holidays. We\n          always have a large number of virtual receptionists on call, so no\n          matter what time a business reaches out for technical support, our\n          team will be ready to take action.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If a customer reaches out for help hours before your offices open, or\n          over the weekend when your offices are closed, one of our virtual\n          receptionists will always be there to answer their phone call. We’ll\n          make them feel cared for by listening to their problems, empathizing\n          with their issue, and letting them know that help is just around the\n          corner.\n        </p>\n        <h2>How we’ll act in urgent situations</h2>\n        <p>\n          The way we go about contacting you and your colleagues when urgent\n          technical support situations arise is largely up to you. One of the\n          first things we’ll go over when setting up your Ring Savvy service is\n          how you want urgent calls handled and directed.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Most IT companies ask that we contact a designated line of their\n          choosing (for example the owner’s cell phone) when their business\n          receives an urgent request outside of normal office hours. In cases\n          where we make contact with someone from your company, we’ll inform\n          them on who is calling and what the issue is, before giving them the\n          option to have the customer’s call transferred over to their line.\n          This allows IT companies to provide customers with support in real\n          time, and get to work immediately on solving issues. Ring Savvy also\n          offers intelligent dispatching, so if you’d like to have certain\n          technicians on call for certain types of issues or on certain nights\n          of the week, we’ll always be able to transfer your callers to the\n          correct party.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If we can’t immediately get in touch with someone from your company,\n          your customers will still be in good hands. We’ll offer to take a\n          detailed message from the customer, and let them know that it’s being\n          passed along to your IT support team right away. That message will be\n          sent you in text and/or email form, and can be accessed right from\n          your mobile device. Even if you are away from the office, you’ll know\n          right away when an urgent support situation is unfolding.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Everyone needs someone to lean on for support, and Ring Savvy is\n          always prepared to lend IT companies a helping hand.\n        </p>\n      </SecondaryContent>\n      <Testimonials />\n      <FaqAccordion

During the setup process, you’ll get to decide\n          when our receptionists should give your callers the option to book an\n          appointment with you, and how much flexibility our receptionists have\n          in booking appointments on your behalf.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Ring Savvy’s receptionist team members will always respect the\n          integrity of your existing calendar, meaning that they will never\n          alter already established appointments or events in your calendar, and\n          will never double book you. Our receptionists will only look to book\n          appointments with callers in time slots that you have pre-designated\n          as available. You’ll also never have to stress over sharing your\n          calendar with receptionists you’ve never met before. We use a third\n          party software, that not only integrates with your calendar, but keeps\n          your other calendar appointments completely confidential.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          After a receptionist books an appointment with one of your callers,\n          you’ll immediately receive a text and/or email message with full\n          information on the date and time of the appointment, who you’ll be\n          meeting with, and what the meeting will be about.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Why use our appointment scheduling services?</h2>\n        <p>\n          As a business owner, your days or more often than not quite busy, and\n          there’s a good chance you’ll miss a few calls from prospective\n          customers or potential new business partners. Sure you could waste\n          precious time at the end of your work day trying to reach these missed\n          callers so you can hopefully book an appointment with them, but the\n          better option may be to let Ring Savvy’s trained virtual receptionist\n          team speak with your callers in real time, and take care of the\n          appointment booking for you.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Keep in mind that Appointment Scheduling is a completely optional\n          service, that comes to our customers at no additional cost. Some\n          business owners will feel that it is necessary to speak with a\n          potential customer or associate first before booking them an\n          appointment, and for those owners, there is still plenty to love about\n          Ring Savvy’s 24/7 phone coverage, without utilizing our appointment\n          scheduling feature. But, for those that would rather have someone else\n          handle appointment booking with their callers, Ring Savvy’s virtual\n          receptionist team will prove to be incredibly valuable.\n        </p>\n      </SecondaryContent>\n      <Testimonials />\n      <FaqAccordion contentData={contentData.find((data) => data.id === 1)} />\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n","import React from 'react';\nimport { Helmet } from 'react-helmet';\nimport Layout from '../components/layout';\nimport Hero from '../components/hero';\nimport SecondaryContent from '../components/secondaryContent';\n\nexport default function TermsOfService({ location }) {\n  const heroData = {\n    heading: 'Terms Of Service',\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <Layout location={location}>\n      <Helmet>\n        <title>Terms Of Service - RingSavvy, Inc.</title>\n        <meta\n          name='description'\n          content='Ring Savvy Privacy Policy - All Rights Reserved - Read More Here For Specifications On Conditions and Use - Limitations and Disclaimers'\n        />\n      </Helmet>\n      <Hero heading={heroData.heading} />\n      <SecondaryContent maxWidth='780px'>\n        <p>\n          <strong>\n            This Answering Services Agreement (“Agreement”) is by and between\n            Ring Savvy, Inc d/b/a Ring Savvy (“Ring Savvy”) and (“Customer”).

In order to effectively handle all of your\n          grooming company’s incoming calls and new appointment requests, you’ll\n          want to invest in a little help from Ring Savvy’s virtual receptionist\n          team. Our 24/7 service will make sure your business is always able to\n          capture the new customer over the phone, and never becomes overwhelmed\n          by sloppy scheduling.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Ring Savvy can book appointments on your behalf</h2>\n        <p>\n          We know a large portion of a pet grooming shop’s incoming calls will\n          be from people looking to book an appointment for their dog or cat to\n          be groomed, bathed, or trimmed. That’s why pet groomers should only\n          consider investing in a phone answering service that actually trains\n          its receptionists in appointment scheduling. If you fail to do this,\n          you’re going to leave a large portion of your incoming callers\n          frustrated and will likely send them looking elsewhere for their pet\n          grooming needs.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Appointment scheduling is an optional feature at Ring Savvy, but one\n          that all pet grooming companies will want to take advantage of. With\n          this feature turned on, our highly trained virtual receptionists will\n          be given the ability to book appointments directly into your work\n          calendar. Our receptionists have booked hundreds, and in some cases\n          thousands of new appointments before, and can be trusted to always be\n          accurate when entering in new appointment information. Their efforts\n          will save your from having to spend hours on the phone calling back\n          customers and booking appointments yourself.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Ring Savvy utilizes a third party software, that can integrate with\n          whatever calendaring software your business is currently using, while\n          keeping your other calendar appointments completely confidential. Our\n          receptionists will only book new appointments in time slots that you\n          predetermine to be available, and will always send you a text and/or\n          email message when a new appointment has been booked.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Personalized phone answering for your business</h2>\n        <p>\n          For those worried that using virtual receptionists may make their\n          grooming shop come off as a bit impersonal, you should know that Ring\n          Savvy’s service is 100% customizable. Once you begin using Ring Savvy,\n          you’ll get the chance to personalize the way we greet your customers,\n          the way we go about transferring over certain calls to you and your\n          staff, and the new customer intake questions we ask your potential\n          customers.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Our receptionists will also be able to answer any frequently asked\n          questions your business receives. For example, we’ll be able to inform\n          customers on how long a dog’s bath typically takes or what additional\n          grooming services your shop is able to provide. When beginning your\n          relationship with Ring Savvy, you’ll just need to share with us the\n          answers to some of your business’ top FAQs, and we’ll make sure our\n          receptionists always have that information on hand and ready to share.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          With our team taking over a large portion of your call handling and\n          new customer intake responsibilities, you’ll have more to devote to\n          running your business and giving the animals you groom the top quality\n          care they deserve.\n        </p>\n

Being distracted in a construction or\n          contracting environment can mean a structure not being built correctly\n          or even someone getting hurt. Unfortunately for those running\n          construction and contracting businesses, any phone call can present\n          significant monetary opportunity, and ignoring calls is hard to do.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If you’re tired of incoming calls disrupting the flow of your work\n          days, it’s time to invest in some professional phone answering\n          assistance. Ring Savvy’s team of virtual receptionists will provide\n          your company with 24/7 phone coverage, and allow construction workers\n          and contractors to go about their work days without having to\n          constantly step away or pause work to answer calls.\n        </p>\n        <h2>With Ring Savvy you don’t have to stress over missed calls</h2>\n        <p>\n          At Ring Savvy we remain fully staffed with highly trained virtual\n          receptionists at all hours of the day and night. This guarantees that\n          we always have experienced receptionists ready to field calls on\n          behalf of all the businesses we serve. As a Ring Savvy customer, you\n          can feel comfortable not picking up a call, because you’ll have the\n          confidence of knowing one of our highly competent receptionists will\n          be there to speak to the caller on your behalf. We’ll give your\n          callers the live attention they are looking for, and make sure they\n          never have to deal with the frustration of being sent to your\n          voicemail machine.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Check new messages during your downtime</h2>\n        <p>\n          When breaks arise during your work day, you’ll be able to catch up on\n          all the calls you missed right from your mobile device. Whenever we\n          field a call on your behalf, we’ll record a message detailing what the\n          call was about, and send that message to you via SMS text and/or\n          email. You’ll be able to catch up on work messages during your\n          downtime with the same level of efficiency you review personal texts\n          and emails.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          When potential new customers call in, our receptionist will take them\n          through the new customer intake process. We’ll gather your prospects\n          personal information, and ask your callers specific questions of your\n          choosing. For example, if you want us to ask all your new callers if\n          they are looking to hire a crew for a “residential or commercial job”,\n          we absolutely can. All of the information we gather will be sent to\n          you in message form at the conclusion of the call, and if our intake\n          indicates an exciting new opportunity for your company, you can call\n          the customer back right away.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          When an existing customer or associate calls in, our receptionist will\n          take an accurate and detailed message from them. With the ability to\n          view new messages right from your phone you can determine whether the\n          person who called in requires an immediate call back, can be\n          accommodated with a simple text, or can be dealt with at a later time.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Our advanced message taking services can also be useful for\n          construction companies looking for help communicating with Spanish\n          speaking callers. Our receptionist team always has bilingual\n          receptionists ready to field calls on your behalf, and can perform new\n          customer intakes or record customer messages from a Spanish speaking\n          individual, before sending that messages to your mobile phone fully\n          translated. Ring Savvy’s team is willing to do whatever it taxes to\n          make sure construction workers and contractors never miss the chance\n          to win new business, and can always be trusted to do the job right the\n          first time.\n        </p>\n      </SecondaryContent>\n      <Testimonials />\n      <FaqAccordion contentData={contentData.find((data) => data.id === 1)} />\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n","import styled from 'styled-components';\n\n//TODO: Refactor to use differrent grids.

Our 24/7 virtual\n          receptionist team can handle any incoming calls accounting firms don’t\n          have time for, and can allow busy accountants to focus more on numbers\n          than answering phones. Using our answering service is significantly\n          cheaper than hiring full-time phone answering staff for your business,\n          and will make those long days at the office a lot more bearable.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Our team always makes a great first impression</h2>\n        <p>\n          Investing in Ring Savvy’s 24/7 answering service, means that your\n          callers will never have to deal with being sent to voicemail again. If\n          you can’t get to the phone, or simply don’t want to, our receptionist\n          team will always be there to provide your callers with a helpful live\n          voice.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          When using answering services other than Ring Savvy, you’ll be taking\n          a calculated risk, as the quality of the receptionist service you’ll\n          get can greatly vary and will more often than not, disappoint. What\n          makes Ring Savvy different than those other guys is that all our\n          virtual receptionist team members go through months of phone answering\n          and customer service training before being allowed to answer calls on\n          behalf of real companies. Most phone answering services don’t have the\n          patience for such extensive training, but we see it as an absolute\n          necessity.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          By the time a Ring Savvy receptionist answers a call on behalf of your\n          business, they will have answered hundreds of practice calls before,\n          and will know how to best handle any problems your callers present\n          them with. With using Ring Savvy there truly is no risk, and the only\n          thing you’ll need to calculate, is how much extra money we’re helping\n          bring into your business.\n        </p>\n        <h2>\n          We’ll give your business more opportunity to capture new customers\n        </h2>\n        <p>\n          When it comes to lead capturing, providing prospective customers with\n          a live answer over the phone means everything these days. Even if your\n          current in-office staff is really on its game, they still are only\n          going to be able to answer calls during normal office hours.

They will always know just what to say\n          to calm down distressed customers, and keep things moving towards a\n          quick solution.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Providing a live voice when urgent repair situations develop will mean\n          everything to your customers. Imagine how panicked a shipping company\n          will be if their door breaks down early in the morning, and when they\n          call for help, they get sent to your voicemail. Using Ring Savvy means\n          always have a trained professional ready to speak with customers, and\n          never leaving them in the dark during their time of need.\n        </p>\n        <h2>How we alert you of emergency situations</h2>\n        <p>\n          When entrance and loading dock equipment breaks down, there is not a\n          minute to waste, and our virtual receptionist team will always work\n          fast to get a member of your staff on the phone fast. Once our\n          receptionist identifies that a phone call is of the emergency nature,\n          they will put the customer on hold, and attempt to contact a member of\n          your team. Who they try to contact is entirely up to you, and your\n          main point of contact can be different depending on the time of day or\n          type of repair needed. Once we get your designated point of contact on\n          the phone, we’ll let them know who is calling and what type of repair\n          they need, before giving them the option to have the customer’s call\n          transferred over to their line.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Being able to provide customers with real time support at any hour of\n          the day can truly be a game changer for your business. If you help a\n          customer resolve an emergency situation with no or minimal delay to\n          their work day or night, you can expect them to be incredibly\n          grateful. Providing this level of elite 24/7 customer service should\n          lead to plenty of repeat business and new referrals for your company.\n          Ring Savvy will make sure you’re never closing any doors for new\n          financial opportunity.\n        </p>\n      </SecondaryContent>\n      <Testimonials />\n      <FaqAccordion contentData={contentData.find((data) => data.id === 1)} />\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n","var internalObjectKeys = require('../internals/object-keys-internal');\nvar enumBugKeys = require('../internals/enum-bug-keys');\n\nvar hiddenKeys = enumBugKeys.concat('length', 'prototype');\n\n// `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` method\n// https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-object.getownpropertynames\n// eslint-disable-next-line es/no-object-getownpropertynames -- safe\nexports.f = Object.getOwnPropertyNames || function getOwnPropertyNames(O) {\n  return internalObjectKeys(O, hiddenKeys);\n};\n","import React from 'react';\nimport { Helmet } from 'react-helmet';\nimport Layout from '../../components/layout';\nimport Hero from '../../components/hero';\nimport { Section } from '../../components/section';\nimport { Wrapper } from '../../components/wrapper';\nimport { FlexRow } from '../../components/globals';\nimport Industry from '../../components/industry';\n\nexport default function IndustriesIndex({ location }) {\n  const heroData = {\n    heading: 'Industries',\n  };\n\n  const industries = [\n    {\n      name: 'HVAC',\n      description:\n        'With Ring Savvy’s 24/7 live answering service, you’ll be able to provide immediate assistance for those in need of heating or air conditioning assistance or repair.',\n      slug: 'hvac-answering-service',\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'Dental',\n      description:\n        'Overflow call handling from Ring Savvy can be a big help for busy dental offices, as we’ll be able to pick up all the customer calls your staff can’t immediately get to.',\n      slug: 'dental-answering-service',\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'Pet Grooming',\n      description:\n        'Devote more time to making pets look fluffy and adorable, and let Ring Savvy help manage your incoming calls.

Our virtual\n          receptionist team has been carefully trained in screening incoming\n          callers, and quickly determining whether a call is of a scam, spam or\n          sales related nature. In essence, we make sure that you only have to\n          dedicate time to calls relevant to your business.\n        </p>\n        <h2>How does advanced call screening work?</h2>\n        <p>\n          Our virtual receptionist team works 24/7, answering every single one\n          of the calls you and your staff can’t get to. Before even considering\n          transferring a call over to your designated direct phone line, our\n          receptionists will ask callers for their name and their reason for\n          calling. If their answers to these questions indicate that they aren’t\n          a prospective customer or someone relevant to your business, we’ll\n          make sure not to patch their call to you.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Robocalls will immediately be hung up on and have their numbers\n          blocked. Telemarketers, that are clearly running a scam or trying to\n          sell something unrelated to your business will be politely turned\n          away. If a sales call comes in that seems like it could be relevant to\n          your company, our receptionist will take a message and send it to you\n          after the call concludes in text and/or email message form. Doing this\n          ensures that the sales call doesn’t disrupt your day, while still\n          allowing you to review the details of the call at a later time.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Let us help keep your work days on track</h2>\n        <p>\n          Advanced Call Screening from Ring Savvy is designed to save you two\n          things.

Not to mention, it can be difficult\n          to immediately get back into the flow of working after fielding\n          multiple irrelevant phone calls. Utilizing Ring Savvy’s virtual\n          receptionist team will guarantee that you’re only interrupted by phone\n          calls that are actually worthy of your valuable time.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The second thing our Advanced Call Screening service will save you\n          from is aggravation.

Our virtual receptionist team is\n          available to answer all of the incoming calls you and your staff can’t\n          get to throughout the day and night. They’ll know exactly how to\n          interact with your distressed callers and will keep new customer\n          opportunities from passing your company by.\n        </p>\n        <h2>HVAC consumers aren’t looking to shop around</h2>\n        <p>\n          People dealing with a heating or air conditioning issue want help as\n          quickly as possible, and when searching for assistance, will often go\n          with the first business that provides them with a live answer and\n          comes across as competent over the phone. Very few consumers, if any,\n          will leave an HVAC business a voicemail message and patiently wait for\n          a call back, while their family or place of work suffers without heat\n          during the winter or without AC during the summer. When using Ring\n          Savvy, you’ll always be able to provide consumers in urgent situations\n          the immediate live attention they are looking for.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Provide callers emergency assistance in real time</h2>\n        <p>\n          With our virtual receptionists working on behalf of your HVAC company,\n          your callers will never have to wait more than a few rings to speak\n          with a live person. Even if they call in the middle of the night, we\n          will have a trained representative for them to speak with. When\n          customers call in regarding emergency issues, our receptionists will\n          have the ability to transfer the call over to you or a trusted\n          technician right away. For HVAC companies, Ring Savvy offers an\n          on-call dispatch system. Under this system, you can put specific\n          technicians on call for certain nights, and when an emergency\n          situation arises, we’ll know to contact the technician you designate\n          for that time slot first.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Having Ring Savvy dispatch your technicians when you don’t have staff\n          readily available can make your business operate more smoothly, and\n          will ensure a timely response for your customers. We will of course,\n          let your technicians know where they are going, what type of issue the\n          customer is having, and then let the customer know how far away help\n          is.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Additional features for HVAC companies</h2>\n        <p>\n          For less time-sensitive HVAC issues, our receptionists can take your\n          callers through the new customer intake process. We’ll gather all of\n          your caller’s personal information, as well as details like what type\n          of heating or AC issue they are dealing with and how quickly they are\n          looking to be helped. All of the information we gather will be sent\n          your way via text and/or email message, allowing you to always stay on\n          top of new customer opportunities, even if you’re out of office\n          working another job. Our receptionists are even capable of booking\n          installation or repair appointments directly into your calendar,\n          saving your from having to make additional calls.\n        </p>\n      </SecondaryContent>\n      <Testimonials />\n      <FaqAccordion contentData={contentData.find((data) => data.id === 1)} />\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n","var uncurryThis = require('../internals/function-uncurry-this');\n\nmodule.exports = uncurryThis({}.isPrototypeOf);\n","import React from 'react';\nimport { OneThird } from '../globals';\nimport * as Styled from './style';\n\nconst Value = ({ value, isFirst }) => {\n  const { heading, content, ctaLink } = value;\n  return (\n    <OneThird isFirst={isFirst}>\n      {ctaLink ?

With Ring Savvy’s message taking services, monitoring\n          your company’s incoming calls is fast and simple. If you need to go to\n          a meeting outside of your office, all you have to do to stay updated\n          on new messages is look down at your mobile phone device.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          When a new message is sent your way, you’ll have the ability to access\n          whether a caller is in need of an immediate call back or can be\n          reached out to at a later time. Either way, you’ll never have to\n          stress over missed calls, and can always give your full attention to\n          the task you are currently working on.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Why you should trust our message taking team</h2>\n        <p>\n          There are a lot of Message Taking services out there, but few\n          answering services put their phone answering staff through the level\n          of training that Ring Savvy does. Before any of our virtual\n          receptionists are allowed to start answering calls and taking messages\n          on behalf of an actual business like yours, they are carefully\n          schooled by our receptionist management staff for multiple months. We\n          have our trainees watch training videos, shadow other receptionists\n          while they work, and even participate in practice calls to hone their\n          message taking skills.\n        </p>\n        <h4>\n          While training our receptionists on message taking, there are two\n          important things we stress:\n        </h4>\n        <ol>\n          <li>\n            <b>Accuracy:</b> We never want to pass on a message to one of our\n            customers that includes incorrect information or misspelled words.\n            That’s why when training our new receptionists, we make sure they\n            understand the importance of carefully listening to the caller, and\n            asking the caller to clarify or repeat things they say that may be\n            unclear.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <b>Efficiency:</b> We put our receptionists through a lot of\n            practice phone calls before actually putting them into real call\n            handling situations. This level of repetition helps them in learning\n            how to work quickly, and getting the message taking work done while\n            the phone call is still ongoing. This training allows our\n            receptionists to send business owners their customer messages just\n            seconds after a call concludes.\n          </li>\n        </ol>\n        <p>\n          The amount of effort and attention to detail that Ring Savvy gives to\n          its message taking process is truly unmatched.

That’s why\n          all who own landscaping businesses should look to make their lives\n          easier by investing in a landscaping answering service like Ring\n          Savvy. Our virtual receptionists can help you stay more organized\n          throughout the day and always be ready to impress when new customer\n          opportunities arise.\n        </p>\n        <h2>We’ll answer your calls and keep you in the loop</h2>\n        <p>\n          While you’re out on various jobs, and the noise level is incredibly\n          high, you don’t have to feel the pressure of constantly checking your\n          phone or finding a quiet place to answer incoming calls. As a Ring\n          Savvy customer, you can request to have all the calls you can’t answer\n          yourself forwarded to our nice and quiet call center. Our virtual\n          receptionist team remains active 24/7, even on weekends and holidays,\n          and will be prepared to answer all of the calls you can’t get to.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          When our receptionist picks up one of your calls, they will be able to\n          quickly determine if the call is from one of your existing customers,\n          or a person interested in using your landscaping services for the\n          first time. When existing customers dial in, our receptionists will\n          offer to take a message from the caller, and then send that message\n          your way via text and/or email message. You’ll have the ability to\n          review your messages at your own pace, and determine whether a\n          customer requires immediate attention or can have their message\n          addressed at a later time.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          When it comes to new customer opportunities, you’ll get to decide\n          whether we should always attempt to transfer the call back over to\n          you, or have one of our receptionists handle the call and take the\n          prospect through our new customer intake process. In either case,\n          you’ll always be giving your business the best chance to capture new\n          leads. The information we gather during new customer intakes will be\n          sent to your mobile device just like messages from existing customers,\n          so you’ll always be in the know when new opportunity arises for your\n          business. It will always be clearly stated in the message whether the\n          caller is a prospective or existing customer.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Advanced lead capturing services</h2>\n        <p>\n          Ring Savvy is one of the best phone answering services on the market\n          today, because we go beyond just fielding calls and taking messages.\n        </p>\n        <h4>What options do you have with live call transferring?</h4>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <b>Appointment Scheduling:</b> Our receptionists have the ability to\n            book landscaping appointments for you callers, and do so directly\n            into your personal calendar. Your customers will be thrilled to\n            learn they can book an appointment right away, rather than having to\n            wait for a call back at a later time.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <b>Bilingual Phone Answering:</b> Ring Savvy always has Spanish\n            speaking receptionists on the clock, and will be to help your\n            business engage with any callers that speak Spanish as their primary\n            language.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <b>New Customer Intake:</b> You’ll have full control over the\n            questions we ask your first-time callers. You’ll always have an idea\n            of what a potential customer is looking for from your business,\n            before deciding to move forward with them as a customer.\n          </li>\n

What this means is that our call center is\n          always fully staffed with a separate call pool of Spanish speaking\n          virtual receptionists — many of whom speak Spanish as their first\n          language — and will always be prepared to help your business engage\n          with Spanish speaking customers.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          By having a separate pool of bilingual receptionists, we are able to\n          ensure that Spanish speaking callers will likely speak to someone who\n          speaks Spanish, without us having to internally transfer the call to\n          someone else who can.\n        </p>\n        <h2>How can a Spanish answering service help you win new customers?</h2>\n        <p>\n          Imagine a Spanish speaking individual is looking to hire a plumber.\n          They call up two businesses, one that only provides English speaking\n          representatives and another that offers both English and Spanish\n          speaking virtual receptionists. Which business do you think they’ll be\n          more likely to give a chance? The business that forces them to talk in\n          a language they may not be fully comfortable speaking in, or the\n          business that immediately presents them with options and is ready to\n          accommodate their specific communication needs.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          In more cases than not, the Spanish speaking customers you’re trying\n          to reach will choose the latter option. Making your new prospects feel\n          at their most comfortable on the phone is essential to winning new\n          business in today’s consumer world. So if you’re business doesn’t\n          already have Spanish speaking receptionist staff available, you need\n          to invest in bilingual receptionist support right away.\n        </p>\n        <h2>What makes Ring Savvy the best spanish answering service?</h2>\n        <p>\n          When using Ring Savvy, you don’t just get access to receptionists that\n          speak Spanish, but highly trained Spanish speaking receptionists.

People will\n          be calling all day long to book new appointments, change and cancel\n          scheduled appearances, ask questions about their insurance coverage,\n          and find out information about certain procedures. Even if you have a\n          dedicated receptionist staff already in-place, you’ll want to invest\n          in additional phone answering coverage from Ring Savvy to make life\n          easier for your and your staff, and make sure your office never misses\n          out on any new business opportunities.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Overflow call handling can make A big difference</h2>\n        <p>\n          The Ring Savvy virtual receptionist team is fully staffed at all hours\n          of the day and night, and will be ready to handle all of the incoming\n          calls your in-office staff is unable to pick up on its own. For\n          example, if you have three receptionists busy on the phone engaging\n          with customers, and a fourth call comes in, your office will never be\n          forced to put a caller on hold. One of our virtual receptionists will\n          be there to pick up the fourth call for you, greet the customer, and\n          gather information about the person’s reason for calling.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The information our receptionist gathers from your caller will be sent\n          to you and your receptionist staff via text and/or email message,\n          allowing someone from your team to follow up with the caller at a less\n          busy time. Having Ring Savvy’s overflow call handling system in place\n          will make a much better impression on calling customers than leaving\n          them on hold for several minutes. Providing callers with a live\n          immediate response shows callers that your office truly cares about\n          their issue, and is always ready to make their dental needs a top\n          priority.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Our receptionists can book appointments too!</h2>\n        <p>\n          When a person is dealing with a dental emergency, they will in many\n          cases not be able to rest until they have made contact with a live\n          receptionist from a dentist’s office, and have an actual appointment\n          to get help in place. If your office has no one ready to book a caller\n          an appointment, you’re likely to miss out on their business, as the\n          customer will probably just move on to calling another dentist in your\n          area.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Part of what makes Ring Savvy a great fit for dentist’s offices is\n          that we’re able to provide callers in pain or distress with both a\n          live caring voice and the ability to book an appointment right away.\n          We’ll always have a highly trained receptionist ready to talk with\n          your customers, even if their call comes in the middle of the night.\n          You’ll also have the option of allowing Ring Savvy’s receptionists to\n          book appointments directly into your business’ calendar. Our\n          receptionists will only book emergency appointments into time slots\n          that you deem to be available, and will always send you a message to\n          inform you of the newly scheduled appointment.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If you’re like most dentists, you probably sink a lot of money into\n          advertising and generating new leads.

And when people worry, they tend to ask a lot of\n          questions. If you’re in the finance or mortgage business, and are\n          responsible for either handling people’s money or helping people make\n          significant purchases, you better make yourself available to answer\n          questions 24/7. If you don’t, and let a large portion of your calls go\n          to voicemail, you can expect customers to turn on you very quickly.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Fortunately providing 24/7 live phone coverage doesn’t have to be\n          difficult.

Ring\n          Savvy’s team can guarantee that all of your company’s calls will get\n          answered by a live trained professional, no matter how many incoming\n          calls your recieve, and no matter what time a customer calls into your\n          business.

When signing up with Ring Savvy, you’ll tell us which\n            situations should qualify for a live transfer, and what times of day\n            we should attempt to transfer calls over to your designated direct\n            line.

Using\n          information provided by you, our receptionist will have the ability to\n          answer any common FAQs callers might have about your business.

Our\n          receptionist will greet the caller and let them know the business they\n          have reached, before moving on to asking how they can be of\n          assistance.

What qualifies as an important call? That’s for\n          you to determine. At the beginning of your relationship with Ring\n          Savvy, you’ll let us know which types of calls you’d like to have\n          transferred to you. For example, many of our customers will only want\n          to be contacted when a person calls into their business for the first\n          time.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          At the start of every call our receptionists handle, they will ask\n          your caller for their name and reason for calling. If they identify\n          the caller as someone you have asked to immediately speak with, they\n          will ask the caller to briefly hold while they attempt to get you on\n          the phone.\n        </p>\n        <h2>What options do you have with live call transferring?</h2>\n        <p>\n          Once a Ring Savvy virtual receptionist makes contact with you, and\n          briefs you on the person calling, you’ll have two options.\n        </p>\n        <ol>\n          <li>\n            Our virtual receptionist can transfer you the call, allowing you to\n            speak with the caller right away.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            You can decline to take the call. Our virtual receptionist will then\n            inform the caller that you are currently unavailable, and take a\n            message. If the caller is a potential new customer, our receptionist\n            will be able to gather all of their essential information through\n            our new customer intake process.\n          </li>\n        </ol>\n        <p>\n          There will of course be times where one of our virtual receptionists\n          tries to reach you and you still can’t get to the phone. In those\n          cases, our receptionist will follow the protocol laid out in the\n          second option listed above.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Let Ring Savvy simplify your call handling process</h2>\n        <p>\n          Today, consumers are severely lacking in patience, and we know that\n          there’s a lot of pressure for businesses to talk with potential new\n          customers in real time.

At Ring Savvy, all of our new receptionist hires go through\n          months of individual training, before being allowed to answer calls on\n          behalf of real companies. We carefully school our virtual\n          receptionists on answering calls for different types of businesses,\n          phone etiquette, performing new customer intakes, and much more!

Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n * name of the component).\n *\n * ---\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 1 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n *   exiting:  { opacity: 0 },\n *   exited:  { opacity: 0 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {state => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete. Let's take\n * the following example (we'll use the\n * [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook):\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>\n *         {state => (\n *           // ...\n *         )}\n *       </Transition>\n *       <button onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state\n * and stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches\n * to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from\n * `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n */\n\nvar Transition = /*#__PURE__*/function (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    var _this;\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call(this, props, context) || this;\n    var parentGroup = context; // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ? props.enter : props.appear;\n    var initialStatus;\n    _this.appearStatus = null;\n\n    if (props.in) {\n      if (appear) {\n        initialStatus = EXITED;\n        _this.appearStatus = ENTERING;\n      } else {\n        initialStatus = ENTERED;\n      }\n    } else {\n      if (props.unmountOnExit || props.mountOnEnter) {\n        initialStatus = UNMOUNTED;\n      } else {\n        initialStatus = EXITED;\n      }\n    }\n\n    _this.state = {\n      status: initialStatus\n    };\n    _this.nextCallback = null;\n    return _this;\n  }\n\n  Transition.getDerivedStateFromProps = function getDerivedStateFromProps(_ref, prevState) {\n    var nextIn = _ref.in;\n\n    if (nextIn && prevState.status === UNMOUNTED) {\n      return {\n        status: EXITED\n      };\n    }\n\n    return null;\n  } // getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps) {\n  //   let nextStatus = null\n  //   if (prevProps !== this.props) {\n  //     const { status } = this.state\n  //     if (this.props.in) {\n  //       if (status !== ENTERING && status !== ENTERED) {\n  //         nextStatus = ENTERING\n  //       }\n  //     } else {\n  //       if (status === ENTERING || status === ENTERED) {\n  //         nextStatus = EXITING\n  //       }\n  //     }\n  //   }\n  //   return { nextStatus }\n  // }\n  ;\n\n  var _proto = Transition.prototype;\n\n  _proto.componentDidMount = function componentDidMount() {\n    this.updateStatus(true, this.appearStatus);\n  };\n\n  _proto.componentDidUpdate = function componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\n    var nextStatus = null;\n\n    if (prevProps !== this.props) {\n      var status = this.state.status;\n\n      if (this.props.in) {\n        if (status !== ENTERING && status !== ENTERED) {\n          nextStatus = ENTERING;\n        }\n      } else {\n        if (status === ENTERING || status === ENTERED) {\n          nextStatus = EXITING;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    this.updateStatus(false, nextStatus);\n  };\n\n  _proto.componentWillUnmount = function componentWillUnmount() {\n    this.cancelNextCallback();\n  };\n\n  _proto.getTimeouts = function getTimeouts() {\n    var timeout = this.props.timeout;\n    var exit, enter, appear;\n    exit = enter = appear = timeout;\n\n    if (timeout != null && typeof timeout !== 'number') {\n      exit = timeout.exit;\n      enter = timeout.enter; // TODO: remove fallback for next major\n\n      appear = timeout.appear !== undefined ? timeout.appear : enter;\n    }\n\n    return {\n      exit: exit,\n      enter: enter,\n      appear: appear\n    };\n  };\n\n  _proto.updateStatus = function updateStatus(mounting, nextStatus) {\n    if (mounting === void 0) {\n      mounting = false;\n    }\n\n    if (nextStatus !== null) {\n      // nextStatus will always be ENTERING or EXITING.\n      this.cancelNextCallback();\n\n      if (nextStatus === ENTERING) {\n        this.performEnter(mounting);\n      } else {\n        this.performExit();\n      }\n    } else if (this.props.unmountOnExit && this.state.status === EXITED) {\n      this.setState({\n        status: UNMOUNTED\n      });\n    }\n  };\n\n  _proto.performEnter = function performEnter(mounting) {\n    var _this2 = this;\n\n    var enter = this.props.enter;\n    var appearing = this.context ? this.context.isMounting : mounting;\n\n    var _ref2 = this.props.nodeRef ?

This will include:\n        </h4>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Their full name</li>\n          <li>The best phone number to reach them at</li>\n          <li>Their home address</li>\n          <li>Their email address</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>\n          After all personal information is gathered, our receptionists will\n          move on to collecting information about the caller’s reason for\n          contacting your business. They will accomplish this by asking specific\n          questions, which you’ll be able to customize when setting up your\n          account with Ring Savvy.\n        </p>\n        <h4>\n          Here are a few examples of questions we can ask on behalf of different\n          businesses:\n        </h4>\n        <p>\n          <b>For plumbing companies we can ask:</b>{' '}\n          <i>\n            “Are you reaching out today for help with an installation or\n            repair?”\n          </i>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <b>For pet grooming companies we can ask:</b>{' '}\n          <i>“What breed of dog are you looking to make an appointment for?”</i>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <b>For real estate companies we can ask:</b>{' '}\n          <i>“Are you looking to buy or sell property?”</i>\n        </p>\n      </SecondaryContent>\n      <Testimonials />\n      <FaqAccordion contentData={contentData.find((data) => data.id === 1)} />\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
