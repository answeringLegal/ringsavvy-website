          Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you
          with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to
          provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to
          customize our service to make your experience more worthwhile. We use
          data collection devices such as “cookies” on certain pages of our
          site. “Cookies” are small files placed on your hard drive that assist
          us in providing customized services. We also offer certain features
          that are only available through the use of a “cookie.” Cookies can
          also help us provide information which is targeted to your interests.
          Most cookies are “session cookies,” meaning that they are
          automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.
          You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits,
          although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on
          our site. Additionally, you may encounter “cookies” or other similar
          devices on certain pages of our site that are placed by third parties.
          For example, if you view a web page created by a user, there may be a
          “cookie” placed within that web page. We do not control the use of
          cookies by third parties. If you choose to post messages in our chat
          rooms or other message areas or leave feedback for other users, we
          will collect that information you provide to us. You agree to use
          these communication services at your own risk and cannot hold Ring
          Savvy, Inc. liable for any misinformation you receive as a result from
          using these services. If you send us personal correspondence, such as
          emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us
          correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may
          collect such information into a file specific to you.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Use of Your Information.</h2>

        <p>
          We use information in the file we maintain about you, and other
          information we obtain from your current and past activities on the
          Site, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems. At times, we may
          look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes.
          You agree that we may use personally identifiable information about
          you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze site
          usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize our
          site’s content, layout, and services. These uses improve our site and
          better tailor it to meet your needs. You agree that we may use your
          information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in
          some cases, are targeted to your interests, such as targeted banner
          advertisements, administrative notices, product offerings, and
          communications relevant to your use of the Site. By accepting the
          Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information. If
          you do not wish to receive these communications, we encourage you to
          opt out of the receipt of certain communications by contacting us via

        <h2>Our Disclosure of Your Information.</h2>

        <p>
          Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all
          of your private communications and other personally identifiable
          information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in
          this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the
          foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government
          or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may
          unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private
          communications, or users may abuse or misuse your information that
          they collect from our Site. Therefore, although we use industry
          standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you
          should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or
          private communications will always remain private. As a matter of
          policy, we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information
          about you to any third party. However, the following describes some of
          the ways that your personally identifiable information may be
          disclosed. We aggregate (gather up data across all user files)
          personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a
          non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third
          parties for other marketing and promotional purposes. However, in
          these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information
          that could be used to identify you personally. If you have any
          questions concerning our Privacy Policy or User Agreement, please do
          not hesitate to contact us by email at{' '}
